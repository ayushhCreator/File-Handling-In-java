File Handling Project (Text and Excel) using Java and Apache POI

**Description**:
This Java-based Maven project demonstrates the implementation of file handling operations in two categories:
1. **Text File Handling**: The project includes functionalities to read from and write to text files using standard Java I/O classes.
2. **Excel File Handling**: The project uses the Apache POI library to perform read and write operations on Excel files. 

This project includes:
- `ReadTextFile.java` and `WriteTextFile.java` to handle text files.
- `ReadExcelFile.java` and `WriteExcelFile.java` to handle Excel files.

**Dependencies**:
The `pom.xml` file is configured with necessary dependencies, such as Apache POI for Excel file operations.

**Key Features**:
- Read and write operations for both text and Excel files.
- Efficient use of Java I/O for text files and Apache POI for Excel file processing.
- Well-structured packages and modular code for scalability and maintainability.

**How to Run**:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run each class to see file handling in action.
4. Ensure Maven dependencies are correctly installed.

**Project Structure**:
- `com.tripillar.filehandling.text` package: Contains text file operations.
- `com.tripillar.filehandling.excel` package: Contains Excel file operations using Apache POI.

**Learning and Challenges**:
This project helped in learning the essentials of Java file handling, Maven for dependency management, and using external libraries like Apache POI.
